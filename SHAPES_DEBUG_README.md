# Shapes Tool Debugging and Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Canvas Initialization Timing**: Added proper canvas readiness checks to prevent accessing undefined canvas properties.

2. **Shapes Tool Debugging**: Enhanced logging to track:
   - Shape creation process
   - Drawing parameters (dimensions, stroke, color)
   - Canvas layer structure
   - Shape addition to parent containers

3. **Visibility Safeguards**: Added checks to ensure:
   - Minimum stroke width of 1px
   - Minimum shape size of 5px to be visible
   - Detailed logging of shape properties

4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and canvas state validation.

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Open the coursebuilder page** in your browser
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Load the debug script**:
   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the content of debug_shapes_advanced.js into the console
   ```

4. **Run basic tests**:
   ```javascript
   // Test direct shape creation
   shapesDebug.testShapesDirectly();
   
   // Test shapes tool behavior
   shapesDebug.testShapesToolBehavior();
   
   // Check layer visibility
   shapesDebug.checkLayerVisibility();
   ```

5. **Manual testing**:
   - Click on the shapes tool button
   - Select rectangle, circle, or triangle
   - Draw on the canvas by clicking and dragging
   - Check the console for detailed logging

## Expected Console Output:

When shapes are working correctly, you should see:
```
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Initialized with rectangle, triangle, and circle support
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Default settings - Color: #1f2937, Stroke: 4px, Fill: disabled
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Started drawing rectangle at (300, 200)
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Drawing rectangle - Width: 100, Height: 50, Stroke: 4px, Color: #1f2937
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Drawing rectangle at (300, 200) with size 100x50
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Applying stroke style: {width: 4, color: 2037047, cap: "round", join: "round"}
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Finished drawing professional rectangle - Final size: 100x50
ðŸ”¶ SHAPES: Shape added to parent with 1 total children
```

## If Shapes Still Not Visible:

1. **Check canvas container**: Verify the canvas container exists and has proper dimensions
2. **Check PIXI availability**: Ensure PIXI is loaded and Graphics objects can be created
3. **Check layer structure**: Verify drawing layer exists and is visible
4. **Check coordinate system**: Ensure drawing coordinates are within canvas bounds

## Debug Files Created:
- `debug_shapes.js`: Basic debugging functions
- `debug_shapes_advanced.js`: Advanced testing with event simulation

These files contain functions to help diagnose exactly where the issue is occurring.
