# CourseBuilder Tools Improvements - Round 2

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### âœ… **1. Pen Tool Green Indicator - Fixed Blinking**
**Problem**: Green indicator was blinking/pulsing when hovering over the final anchor point.
**Solution**: 
- Removed the `animateHoverIndicator()` method completely
- Changed to static, subtle desaturated green colors:
  - Fill: `#4ade80` (subtle green) with 60% opacity
  - Stroke: `#22c55e` (desaturated green border) with 80% opacity  
- Updated CSS to remove the `penHoverPulse` animation
- Result: Clean, non-distracting indicator that's visible but subtle

### âœ… **2. Text Tool Canvas Positioning - Enhanced**
**Problem**: Text area appeared outside canvas bounds.
**Solution**:
- Improved canvas bounds detection and positioning
- Added automatic positioning adjustment to keep text area within canvas
- Enhanced text area persistence by:
  - Adding delayed event binding to prevent immediate blur
  - Adding `isTextAreaJustCreated` flag to ignore premature blur events
  - Adding click/mousedown event prevention to stop canvas interference
  - Storing container reference for proper cleanup
- Result: Text areas now stay within canvas and persist until user finishes editing

### âœ… **3. Shapes Tool Selection - Complete Redesign**
**Problem**: Could only select rectangles; triangle and circle weren't selectable.
**Solution**:
- **HTML Changes**: Replaced dropdown `<select>` with individual shape buttons
  - Added `data-shape` attributes for rectangle, triangle, circle
  - Each button has visual SVG icons
- **CSS Additions**: Added proper styling for shape buttons
  - Hover effects, selected states, visual feedback
  - Consistent button sizing and spacing
- **JavaScript Updates**: 
  - Modified `UIEventHandler` to properly bind to shape buttons
  - Updated `ToolStateManager.updateShapeUI()` to work with new buttons
  - Added automatic initialization of default shape (rectangle)
- Result: All three basic shapes (rectangle, triangle, circle) are now selectable

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### New CSS Classes Added
```scss
.shape-buttons { /* Container for shape selection buttons */ }
.shape-btn { /* Individual shape button styling */ }
.shape-btn.selected { /* Selected state styling */ }
```

### New Methods Added
- `TextTool.handleTextBlur()` - Improved blur event handling
- `UIEventHandler.initializeDefaultShapeSelection()` - Auto-select rectangle
- Enhanced shape button event handling

### Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `animateHoverIndicator()` method from PenTool
- Removed unused CSS `@keyframes penHoverPulse` animation
- Cleaned up TypeScript type issues

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Improvements

1. **Pen Tool**: Subtle, professional green indicator (no more blinking)
2. **Text Tool**: Reliable text input that stays within canvas bounds
3. **Shapes Tool**: Visual button interface with clear selection feedback

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

### Pen Tool
- Create a path with 3+ nodes
- Hover over the starting node - should see subtle green indicator
- No blinking or animation should occur

### Text Tool  
- Click anywhere on canvas to place text
- Text area should appear and stay visible
- Should remain within canvas boundaries
- Type text and press Escape or click elsewhere to finalize

### Shapes Tool
- Select shapes tool
- Should see three buttons: Rectangle, Triangle, Circle  
- Click each button - should show visual selection state
- Create shapes with each selected type

All improvements maintain backward compatibility and professional visual standards.
