He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the laws of electrolysis.

In physics, Huygens made seminal contributions to optics and mechanics, while as an astronomer he studied the rings of Saturn and discovered its largest moon, Titan. As an engineer and inventor, he improved the design of telescopes and invented the pendulum clock, the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. A talented mathematician and physicist, Huygens authored the first modern treatise where a physical problem was idealized using mathematical parameters, while his work on light contains the first mathematical and mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon.","birthDate":"1629","deathDate":"1695","birthPlace":"The Hague","deathPlace":"The Hague","occupation":"astronomer","imageUrl":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Christiaan-huygens4.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Christiaan-huygens4.jpg?width=320"},"timeline":[{"year":1629,"headline":"Born","displayDate":"1629","media":null},{"year":1695,"headline":"Died","displayDate":"1695","media":null}],"fields":[{"name":"mathematics","description":""},{"name":"mechanics","description":""},{"name":"physics","description":""},{"name":"astronomy","description":""}],"related":[{"name":"Galileo Galilei","relation":"influenced by","wikidataId":"Q307"},{"name":"Denis Papin","relation":"student","wikidataId":"Q106208"},{"name":"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz","relation":"student","wikidataId":"Q9047"},{"name":"Frans van Schooten","relation":"doctoral advisor","wikidataId":"Q767210"},{"name":"Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen","relation":"doctoral advisor","wikidataId":"Q2353318"}]},"hendrik-lorentz":{"profile":{"wikidataId":"Q41688","label":"Hendrik Lorentz","description":"Dutch physicist (1853–1928)","extract":"Dutch physicist (1853–1928)","birthDate":"1853","deathDate":"1928","birthPlace":"Arnhem","deathPlace":"Haarlem","occupation":"theoretical physicist","imageUrl":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/H%20A%20Lorentz%20(Nobel).jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/H%20A%20Lorentz%20(Nobel).jpg?width=320"},"timeline":[{"year":1853,"headline":"Born","displayDate":"1853","media":null},{"year":1928,"headline":"Died","displayDate":"1928","media":null}],"fields":[{"name":"theoretical physics","description":""}],"related":[{"name":"Adriaan Daniel Fokker","relation":"student","wikidataId":"Q367575"},{"name":"Pieter Rijke","relation":"doctoral advisor","wikidataId":"Q9286544"}]}}
