# Layers Panel Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Styling Improvements
**Problem**: Layers panel had cramped spacing, poor hover effects, and twitchy interactions.

**Solution**: Enhanced CSS styling in `src/scss/components/_cards.scss`:
- Increased padding from `6px 8px` to `8px 10px` for better breathing room
- Added smoother transitions with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` easing
- Improved hover colors using `--color-primary-300` and `--color-primary-25`
- Added subtle box shadow on hover for better visual feedback
- Reduced transform movement to `1px` for less twitchy feel

### 2. Nested Items Spacing
**Problem**: Grouped/nested items were too close to their parent elements.

**Solution**: 
- Increased nested item margin-left from `16px` to `20px`
- Added vertical spacing with `margin-top: 4px` and `margin-bottom: 4px`
- Enhanced nested styling with better border colors and backgrounds
- Added proper CSS for `.layers-list` with nested list styling

### 3. Duplicated Groups Not Showing
**Problem**: When duplicating grouped collections, the duplicates weren't appearing in layers panel.

**Solution**: Fixed in `src/scripts/coursebuilder/tools/selection/SelectionClipboard.ts`:
- Added proper `__toolType = 'container'` marking for duplicated groups
- Ensured child objects go through DisplayObjectManager for proper registration
- Fixed the container construction logic to avoid double-adding children

### 4. Animation Scene Integration
**Problem**: Objects placed inside animation scenes weren't showing up as children in layers panel.

**Solution**: Enhanced in multiple files:

**Scene.ts**: 
- Added proper object marking when adding to scenes (`__inScene`, `__parentSceneId`)
- Ensured objects get appropriate `__toolType` based on their class
- Added event dispatch to notify layers panel of changes

**LayersPanel.ts**:
- Updated `isRealObject()` method to recognize scene objects
- Added checks for `__sceneContent`, `__parentSceneId`, `__inScene`
- Added support for `objectId` tracking used in animations

## Color System Enhancement
Added `--color-primary-25` to the color system for ultra-subtle hover highlights.

## Files Modified
1. `src/scss/components/_cards.scss` - Enhanced layer styling
2. `src/scss/abstracts/_colors.scss` - Added primary-25 color
3. `src/scripts/coursebuilder/ui/LayersPanel.ts` - Improved nested styling and object recognition
4. `src/scripts/coursebuilder/tools/selection/SelectionClipboard.ts` - Fixed duplication registration
5. `src/scripts/coursebuilder/animation/Scene.ts` - Enhanced scene object integration

## Result
- **Better UX**: Smoother, less twitchy interactions with improved spacing
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between parent and child items
- **Complete Functionality**: All duplicated groups now appear in layers
- **Scene Integration**: Objects in animation scenes properly appear as scene children
- **Professional Look**: Consistent with modern design standards
