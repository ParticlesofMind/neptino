## Tips & Tricks

- **Tab key**: Move to next cell and save current one
- **Escape**: Cancel editing (reverts to original value)
- **Read-only columns**: Learning style & assessment score can't be edited
- **Success message**: Look for "Student updated successfully" or "Student deleted successfully"
- **Undo deletion**: Need to re-upload or re-add the student (no undo button)

## What Changed?

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Editing | Upload new roster | Edit inline, saves to database |
| Deleting | Re-upload roster | Delete button with confirmation |
| Refresh | Students disappeared | Students persist ✓ |
| Styling | Simple table | Interactive with focus states |
| Email | Global unique constraint (broke) | Per-course unique (works) |

---

## Files Modified

- `studentsPreview.ts` - Interactive row rendering

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Student disappears after edit | Refresh page - it's still in database |
| Delete button doesn't work | Check confirmation dialog - make sure you click OK |
| Can't edit a cell | It might be read-only (learning style, assessment score) |
| Changes don't save | Check browser console (F12) for error messages |
| Refresh shows no students | The one-line fix was applied - should work now |
