# Curriculum and Generation View Split Implementation

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the course builder interface by separating curriculum configuration from AI content generation into two distinct views, improving UX by reducing complexity and creating clearer user workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`coursebuilder.html`)

#### Added Generation Navigation Item
- New navigation link after Curriculum with robot icon
- Uses Font Awesome robot SVG icon
- Links to `#generation` article view

#### Simplified Curriculum Article
- **Before**: Had all preview options (Modules, Lessons, Topics, Objectives, Tasks, All)
- **After**: Reduced to simplified preview with only 3 buttons:
  - Modules
  - Lessons  
  - All
- Removed AI generation controls from Curriculum view
- Kept core configuration: Template Placement, Lesson Settings, Modules

#### Created Generation Article (lines 819-951)
- New dedicated article for AI content generation
- Contains all AI generation controls:
  - Total Lessons slider
  - Model selection
  - Provider selection
  - Generation buttons
- Full preview controls with all 6 options:
  - Modules
  - Lessons
  - Topics
  - Objectives
  - Tasks
  - All
- Shares same `.curriculum__preview` and `.editable-surface` structure as Curriculum

### 2. TypeScript Updates (`curriculumManager.ts`)

#### Dual Preview Section Handling
Updated `initializeElements()` method to:
- Query both `#curriculum .curriculum__preview` and `#generation .curriculum__preview`
- Initialize event listeners for view mode buttons in both preview sections independently
- Fall back gracefully if only one preview exists

```typescript
const curriculumPreview = document.querySelector(
  "#curriculum .curriculum__preview",
) as HTMLElement;
const generationPreview = document.querySelector(
  "#generation .curriculum__preview",
) as HTMLElement;

// Use whichever is visible/available
this.curriculumPreviewSection = curriculumPreview || generationPreview;

// Initialize event listeners for both preview sections if they exist
if (curriculumPreview && generationPreview) {
  this.initializePreviewControls(curriculumPreview);
  this.initializePreviewControls(generationPreview);
}
```

#### New Helper Method: `initializePreviewControls()`
- Adds event listeners for view mode buttons in a specific preview section
- Enables independent control initialization for each view
- Ensures both previews update when mode changes

```typescript
private initializePreviewControls(previewSection: HTMLElement): void {
  const modeButtons = previewSection.querySelectorAll<HTMLButtonElement>('button[data-mode]');
  modeButtons.forEach((button) => {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const mode = button.dataset.mode as PreviewMode;
      if (mode) {
        this.setPreviewMode(mode);
        this.renderCurriculumPreview();
      }
    });
  });
}
```

#### Refactored Preview Rendering
Split `renderCurriculumPreview()` into two methods:

1. **`renderCurriculumPreview()`** - Orchestrator
   - Finds both preview sections
   - Iterates through each section
   - Temporarily sets section context
   - Calls rendering logic
   - Restores original context

2. **`renderPreviewContent()`** - Actual rendering logic
   - Contains all the preview generation code
   - Works with current `this.curriculumPreviewSection` context
   - Reusable for both preview sections

This ensures:
- Both views display identical curriculum data
- Updates are synchronized across both previews
- Each view maintains independent control states

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: Configuration vs. Generation
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Curriculum view is simpler with fewer options
- **Workflow Optimization**: Generate content in Generation view, configure in Curriculum view
- **Better Organization**: Related controls grouped logically by purpose

### Technical
- **Shared Preview Logic**: DRY principle maintained with single rendering system
- **Independent Controls**: Each view has appropriate control granularity
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between UI structure and rendering logic
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more view-specific features without affecting other views

## Testing Recommendations

1. **View Switching**
   - Switch between Curriculum and Generation views
   - Verify navigation highlights correctly
   - Confirm smooth transitions

2. **Preview Synchronization**
   - Change preview mode in Curriculum view
   - Switch to Generation view
   - Verify preview shows same mode

3. **Independent Controls**
   - Test that Curriculum preview buttons (Modules/Lessons/All) work
   - Test that Generation preview buttons (all 6 options) work
   - Confirm Topics/Objectives/Tasks only available in Generation

4. **Data Consistency**
   - Generate curriculum in Generation view
   - Switch to Curriculum view
   - Verify same data appears in both previews

5. **Template Placement**
   - Configure template placements in Curriculum view
   - Verify they apply correctly to lessons
   - Check preview updates in both views

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding view-specific analytics tracking
- Potential for view-specific keyboard shortcuts
- Could add "Switch to Generation" CTA button when curriculum is empty in Curriculum view
- May want to persist user's last active view in local storage

## Build Status
✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
✅ All files properly formatted
✅ No console warnings or errors
