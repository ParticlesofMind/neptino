# Single Canvas Revert - Summary

## What Was Changed

Reverted the multi-canvas rendering system back to a single canvas implementation to focus on developing the layout system.

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvasInit.ts`
- **Removed**: Event listener for `curriculum-canvases-ready` that triggered multi-canvas loading
- **Removed**: Queue system for pending canvas loads (`pendingCanvasLoads` array)
- **Removed**: Global `loadCourseCanvases()` function used for testing multi-canvas
- **Result**: Canvas initialization now only creates one canvas instance

### 2. `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvas/CanvasAPI.ts`
- **Removed**: Imports for `MultiCanvasManager` and `CanvasDataManager`
- **Removed**: Private properties `multiCanvasManager` and `canvasDataManager`
- **Removed**: Multi-canvas system initialization in `init()` method (Step 8)
- **Removed**: All multi-canvas methods:
  - `loadCourseCanvases(courseId: string)`
  - `navigateToNextCanvas()`
  - `navigateToPreviousCanvas()`
  - `showCanvas(canvasId: string)`
  - `getCurrentCanvas()`
  - `getAllCanvases()`
  - `getCanvasCount()`
  - `getCurrentCanvasIndex()`
  - `onCanvasNavigationChange(callback)`
  - `getMultiCanvasDebugInfo()`
- **Updated**: Zoom and fit-to-viewport methods to use single app instance instead of active canvas
- **Removed**: Multi-canvas manager cleanup in `destroy()` method

## What Still Exists (Untouched)

The following multi-canvas infrastructure files still exist but are no longer used:
- `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvas/MultiCanvasManager.ts`
- `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvas/CanvasDataManager.ts`
- `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvas/VerticalCanvasContainer.ts`
- `src/scripts/coursebuilder/canvas/WrapperFreeCanvasContainer.ts`
- `src/scripts/coursebuilder/ui/CanvasNavigation.ts`
- `MULTI_CANVAS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

These files can be safely ignored or deleted if needed.

## Current State

✅ **Single Canvas System Active**
- One canvas container: `#canvas-container`
- One PIXI application instance
- No multi-canvas loading or navigation
- All tools work on the single canvas

## Database Structure (Unchanged)

The `canvases` table in Supabase still supports multiple canvases per course:
```sql
CREATE TABLE canvases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id UUID NOT NULL,
  lesson_number INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- 1 to N
  canvas_index INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  canvas_data JSONB,
  canvas_metadata JSONB
);
```

This structure remains for future use when multi-canvas is re-implemented.

## Next Steps

With single canvas active, you can now focus on:
1. Developing the layout system
2. Template block management (header, body, footer)
3. Canvas margin and spacing controls
4. Content placement strategies

## Re-enabling Multi-Canvas (Future)

To re-enable multi-canvas in the future:
1. Review `MULTI_CANVAS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for architecture details
2. Restore the removed code from this commit
3. Add back the event listener in `canvasInit.ts`
4. Restore multi-canvas methods in `CanvasAPI.ts`
5. Re-initialize `MultiCanvasManager` in the init flow

## Testing

✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
✅ No TypeScript errors in modified files
✅ Canvas initialization simplified to single instance
