## 🔍 Pasteboard Drawing Diagnostic

**Status:** DEBUGGING ACTIVE - Console logging added to trace the issue

### What I've Added:

1. **Debug Logging in BoundaryUtils.getPasteboardBounds():**
   - ✅ Success case: Logs actual pasteboard bounds returned
   - ❌ Fallback case: Logs when falling back to canvas bounds
   
2. **Debug Logging in BrushTool.onPointerDown():**
   - Logs the pointer coordinates when you click
   - Logs the pasteboard bounds being used for checking
   - Logs whether the point is accepted or rejected

### Next Steps:

1. **Test Drawing:** Open your application and try to draw in the gray pasteboard area
2. **Check Console:** Open browser DevTools and look for these log messages:
   - `🎨 getPasteboardBounds SUCCESS:` - Should show {width: 1800, height: 2700}
   - `📐 getPasteboardBounds FALLBACK:` - Should NOT appear (means PasteboardManager failed)
   - `🖌️ BrushTool onPointerDown:` - Shows coordinates and bounds
   - `✅ BrushTool: Point within pasteboard, allowing draw` - Should appear for gray area clicks

### Hypothesis:

I suspect one of these is happening:
1. **PasteboardManager not initialized** - getPasteboardBounds() is falling back to canvas bounds
2. **Coordinate transformation issue** - The localPoint coordinates aren't matching what we expect
3. **Container clipping** - PIXI is clipping graphics to a smaller area than we think

The console logs will tell us exactly what's happening when you try to draw in the gray area.

**If the logs show that boundaries are correct but drawing still doesn't work, the issue is likely in the PIXI application size or container clipping, not our boundary checking logic.**
